# Week 3 <br> <small>WiDS | Neural Voyage</small>

#TASK 

 You have to implement a basic Neural Network model from scratch

 ## Neural Network
 The below video tutorial consists of both the concept explanation and practical application (coding part) of NN on MNIST dataset.
 You have to watch only till the 7th video of the playlist. (8th video is on deep neural network, which is not our focus for this week)
