## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is Python's essential plotting library, widely used for data visualization. It supports various types of plots and is the foundation for other visualization packages like pandas and Seaborn. Get familiar with Matplotlib through these resources:

## Pandas

Pandas is a Python library used for working with datasets. It is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool. Pandas has data structures for data analysis. The most commonly used data structures are Series and DataFrame. Series is one-dimensional. It consists of one column. DataFrame is two dimensional. It consists of rows and columns. For basic introduction use the following guide:
